# CN Tower Adventure - A Text-Based Adventure Game

## Disclaimer

This game is a work of fiction created solely for entertainment purposes. The characters, events, and settings depicted in this game, including references to the CN Tower, "Quadrobers," and "Patrick" are entirely fictional. I made it for fun and they have a lot of errors!

Any resemblance to real persons, living or deceased, or actual events, locations, or entities is purely coincidental. The developer does not intend to offend, harm, or misrepresent any individuals, groups, or organizations.

## Age Restriction

This game is intended for players aged **16 and above**. By playing this game, you confirm that you meet the age requirement.

## Sweet+ Mode (Optional LGBTQ+ Mode)

The game includes an optional "sweet+" mode (referred to as such in the code), which provides an alternative, more inclusive tone to the game's dialogue. This mode is designed to be humorous and is available in regions where such content is legally permitted. It can be toggled on or off in the debug menu.

**Please note:** In countries where this content might be restricted, the "Sweet+" mode is automatically disabled and removed from the debug menu to comply with local regulations.
